# Calico

Calico is a web engine developed for use with inkle's narrative scripting language Ink.

This project has an itch page [here](https://elliotherriman.itch.io/calico).

Due to browser security issues, you may need to use [Catmint](https://elliotherriman.itch.io/catmint), or run a local server, in order to test your game. These issues won't be present once your game is uploaded to a website like itch.io.

If you're interested in contributing, please don't hesitate to submit a pull request.
