// if you have an ink story that was written for the vanilla web player, 
// then you've probably written your tags in a way that assumes 
// they'll all be processed before any text on that line. 
// if that's the case, and you don't want to edit your ink to run it in here, 
// then this will force all tags to be processed before the line
