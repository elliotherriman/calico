# Calico templates

These are sample projects you can use as a template for your game. 

Due to browser security issues, you may need to use [Catmint](https://elliotherriman.itch.io/catmint), or run a local server if you know how, in order to test your game. These issues won't be present once your game is uploaded to a website like itch.io.

The scripts inside each template — specifically `calico.js`, `ink.js`, and the entire patches folder — are updated each time a new version of Calico is released. If you're running into issues, it may help to copy the latest versions of each from the root of this repository into your folder.
